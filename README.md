# ElasticBeats-Installs
Quick installs for beats on ubuntu OS

Important to note if you want to use these scripts, you must change the host in the config (yml) files for whichever beats you are using.
For Metricbeats, the modules must also be configured where the host and credentials are defined, if you dont want any error logs to show.
